/**
 * @brief Construct a new Place Hatch:: Place Hatch object
 * 
 * This command group will add one sequencial command: the DropHatch command
 */
PlaceHatch::PlaceHatch() {
// END AUTOGENERATED CODE, SOURCE=ROBOTBUILDER ID=CONSTRUCTOR
     // Add Commands here:
    // e.g. AddSequential(new Command1());
    //      AddSequential(new Command2());
    // these will run in order.

    // To run multiple commands at the same time,
    // use AddParallel()
    // e.g. AddParallel(new Command1());
    //      AddSequential(new Command2());
    // Command1 and Command2 will run in parallel.

    // A command group will require all of the subsystems that each member
    // would require.
    // e.g. if Command1 requires chassis, and Command2 requires arm,
    // a CommandGroup containing them would require both the chassis and the
    // arm.
